# PWA Setup Guide

This Next.js application is configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Required Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add the following icon files to the `/public` directory:

- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels

### Generating Icons

You can generate these icons using:

1. Online tools like [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator)
2. Image editing software
3. Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD

### Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG
- Sizes: 192x192 and 512x512 pixels
- Purpose: Should be "any maskable" for best compatibility
- Design: Use your app logo or brand icon

## Testing PWA

   ```bash
   npm run build
